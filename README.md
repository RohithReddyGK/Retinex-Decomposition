## Project Overview

This project performs **Illumination Correction** for images of textured surfaces under uneven lighting using a **Retinex-based log-domain decomposition**. It separates the observed image into:

- **Reflectance (RÃÇ)**: The true surface texture.
- **Illumination (LÃÇ)**: The smooth lighting component.

It works for both **grayscale and color images**, preserving color ratios in color images.

## Algorithm Used

**Step 1:** Convert image to floating-point RGB or grayscale
All pixel values are scaled to [0,1] for numerical stability.

**Step 2:** Why histogram equalization alone cannot recover R(x,y)
Histogram equalization redistributes pixel intensities globally. It may enhance contrast but cannot separate the lighting component from the texture. Shadows and bright spots remain entangled with the true surface texture.In simple word: It says-‚ÄúLet me stretch and balance the brightness levels".But it doesn‚Äôt know: which parts are bright because of light, and which parts are bright because of surface reflectance. So, it blindly brightens or darkens everything, often ruining textures instead of fixing illumination.

**Step 3:** Log-domain decomposition
I(x,y) = R(x,y) * L(x,y) ‚Üí logI = logR + logL. This linearizes the multiplicative relation into an additive one.

**Step 4:** Estimate illumination L(x,y)
Apply a large-kernel box filter via integral image on logI to compute logL, producing a smooth illumination map while ignoring high-frequency textures.

**Step 5:** Recover reflectance R(x,y)
Subtract logL from logI and exponentiate to get RÃÇ. For color images, the same luminance logL is subtracted from each channel.

**Step 6:** Output results
Provide the original image, illumination map, and recovered reflectance, all encoded in base64 for frontend display.

### Mathematical summary:
log I(x,y) = log R(x,y) + log L(x,y)
L(x,y) ‚âà box_filter(log I(x,y))
RÃÇ(x,y) = exp(log I - log L)
